review_applications_start_email_subject: '[[site:name]] It''s almost time to review applications'
review_applications_start_email_body: "Dear [site:name] mentors,\r\n \r\nThank you for posting a project for the [site:name] [muser:round-title] round. Your applications are ready to review. The deadline for reviewing applicants is [muser:review-applications-end]. You may review applications for your projects here:\r\n\r\n[muser:review-applications-url]\r\n\r\nHere are some key things to remember about how [site:name] works for mentors:\r\n\r\n1. Use your own method for choosing students:  \r\nYou can assess applicants based on their essays only or you may wish to interview them in person.  Either way, this process must be completed by the end of the review period on [muser:review-applications-end]. You are responsible for sorting applications and making a final designation of accept or reject. Once you do that, the website will send an automated email that you can edit, and that will inform the students of your decision.   \r\n\r\nYou are not obligated to accept students if you do not find any great matches. However, you must assign applicants to accept or reject status after they have been placed in the review category. As an incentive, the [site:name] website will automatically place a star next to mentor names who completed the process of accepting or rejecting applications.  Students will see these stars when they apply for projects in the next round.\r\n\r\n2.   Communicate directly with your applicants.\r\nIf you accept a student, you are responsible for setting up the research project. [site:name] solely serves to match mentors and students and does not coordinate the projects, meeting times, etc.\r\n \r\nThe deadline for choosing students is [muser:review-applications-end].\r\n \r\nThank you for participating in [site:name].\r\n \r\nThe [site:name] Team\r\n\r\n"

If you are interested in a project that lists a mentor within a principal investigator's lab, you may also wish to look up that particular mentor to learn about their role in the primary lab.</p>\r\n"
