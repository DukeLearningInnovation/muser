Investigate the research group, so that you can gain a basic understanding of their work and express how your particular interests and skills match the project. The research group may have their own website.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many research labs have research mentors who are not the principal investigators or professors. These may include graduate students, postdocs, visiting scientists, lab coordinators, or research administrators. If you are interested in a project that lists a mentor within a principal investigator's lab, you may also wish to look up that particular mentor to learn about their role in the primary lab.</p>\r\n"

Students see the gold star when they apply for projects posted by the mentor during the next round.\r\n\r\nHere are some key things to remember about the [site:name] process:\r\n\r\n1. Use your own method for choosing students:  \r\nYou can assess applicants based on their essays only or you may wish to interview them.  Either way, this process must be completed by the end of the review period on [muser:review-applications-end]. You are responsible for sorting applications and making a final designation of accept or reject on all applications.  You are not obligated to accept students if you do not find any great matches. \r\n\r\n2.   Communicate directly with your applicants.\r\nIf you accept a student, you are responsible for setting up the research project. [site:name] solely serves to match mentors and students and does not coordinate the projects, meeting times, etc.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the round, the [site:name] team emails all students with the final decisions on their applications. \r\n \r\nThe deadline for choosing students is [muser:review-applications-end].\r\n\r\nThere are a number of FAQs at the site that you may wish to read, including a video showing how to perform the application review process, what do do when projects do not receive applicants and when the mentor decides not to accept any applicants. \r\n \r\nThank you for participating in [site:name].\r\n \r\nThe [site:name] Team"
